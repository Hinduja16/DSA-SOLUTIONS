# DSA-SOLUTIONS
# DSA Programs in C

This repository contains implementation programs for fundamental **data** structures and algorithms in C.  
Each file focuses on a single concept or operation so that it is easy to compile, run, and learn from. [web:44][web:48]

## Contents

Some of the topics covered are:

- Searching: `Linear search.c`, `Binary search.c`
- Sorting: `Insertion sort.c`, `Selection sort.c`, other sorting examples
- Stacks and Queues: stack programs, queue using array, queue using linked list, deque
- Linked Lists: creation and display, insertion at beginning/end, deletion from beginning/end, general delete
- Trees: binary tree creation and traversals (preorder, postorder), binary search tree
- Expressions: infix to postfix, postfix expression evaluation
- Other programs: matrix addition, maximum and minimum element, polynomial operations, recursion, reverse array, etc.

(Adjust the file names/extensions above to exactly match your `.c` files.)

## How to run

1. Open any `.c` file in your preferred IDE or text editor.  
2. Compile the program using a C compiler, for example:  
   `gcc file-name.c -o program-name`  
3. Run the executable:  
   `./program-name` on Linux/macOS or `program-name.exe` on Windows. [web:50]

## Purpose

This repository is created to:

- Practice and revise core data structures and algorithms in C.  
- Provide simple reference implementations for common DSA questions.  
- Build a clean, organized coding portfolio for future use. [web:44][web:52]
